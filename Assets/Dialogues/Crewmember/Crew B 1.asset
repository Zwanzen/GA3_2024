  dialogueLines:
  - Regrettable. Well, I am a man of my word so I will not stop you from leaving.
    But with the ongoing situation, I cannot assist you.
  - This is normally the job for a crew, but you'll need to open the hangar doors
    by yourself via the control on the second floor. Then race downstairs and get
    inside one of the fighter jets before the hangar decompresses and the doors open.
  - Oh, and you'll need to find the access card for the hangar bay's control room,
    but I have no idea where it is. You're one your own.
