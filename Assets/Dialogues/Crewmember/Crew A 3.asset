  dialogueLines:
  - 'Ok, look here: At the end of this hallway you can see a ceiling turret just
    in front of the door to the Bridge: there''s another one just like it in front
    of the other entrance as well which makes it impossible to get in!'
  - We need you to access the machine room and disable them using the console there.
    HOWEVER, the last one to hold the keycard apparently left it in the Science Lab
    when this whole debacle started. You need to find it first!
  - Good luck!
