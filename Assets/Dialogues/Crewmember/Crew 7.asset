  dialogueLines:
  - That fixed the oxygen flow! Well done!
  - Thank you for fixing the oxygen flow! It will buy us some time to regain control
    of the spaceship. Now, in my eyes we are already square, but could I ask you
    one last favor?
  - The AI took notice when you took care of the first turret and has increased the
    security around them, making them harder to disable now! Help us disable the
    turrets in front of the bridge so we can enter it and reset the AI!
